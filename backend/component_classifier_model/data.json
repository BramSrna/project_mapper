This eliminates the need for expensive materials, tooling, and production facilities.Simulation can be used to address this issue. The final prototypes will still need to be hardware, but the first iterations can be simulation driven.Lower R&D Costs: Developing software generally requires fewer resources and less time compared to hardware development. Software can be rapidly prototyped, tested, and iterated upon using relatively inexpensive tools and platforms.This overlaps heavily with other problems so better tooling and open-sourcing will help lower rnd costs.Scalability: Software products can be easily scaled to accommodate a growing user base without significant additional costs. Once the initial development work is complete, the marginal cost of serving additional users is often minimal, especially for cloud-based software solutions.Production needs to also be open-sourced so that it is easier to scale as needed. This will be difficult because production facilities requires space, machinery, workforce, and high cost. It's pretty similar to cloud facilities, but cloud facilities are more versatile so that's going to be difficult to address. This could potentially be addressed with better 3d printing or more versatile production facilities.Faster Time to Market: Software development cycles tend to be shorter than hardware development cycles, allowing software companies to bring products to market more quickly. This rapid pace of innovation enables software companies to respond swiftly to market changes and user feedback.This overlaps heavily with other problems so better scaling and tooling will allow for more rapid development cycles.Lower Distribution Costs: Distributing software products is typically more cost-effective than distributing hardware products. Software can be delivered electronically over the internet, eliminating the need for physical distribution channels and associated logistics costs.Use 3d printing to distribute hardware.More accessible production steps so people can make things at home or order them from production facilities online.", "text_label": "Difficulties"}, "8hSjmRZWRbJZ": {"text": "", "text_label": "NestedComponent"}, "wn9S9ZgxYPaA": {"text": "", "text_label": "NestedComponent"}, "R8NCogcxA3fE": {"text": "Recycling Business Stack\n![Alt text](image-1.png)\n- End goal: Circular economy\n- Operating walls:\n    -
