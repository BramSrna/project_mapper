# Mission Statement
- Platform for open source hardware development
- - Platform is fundamentally a project planner from start to finish
- - - Aggregates the various design documents as well as implementation details
- Operating walls:
- - Start: Setting up a project
- - End: Outputting an execution document
- Question: How many implementation tools should the platform have? How much should the platform help with implementation?
- - Ex. Should it have a code editor? Should it have component simulators? etc
- Tools for mapping out hardware and software stack
- - Integrate tools for designing
- - - 3d printing designs
- - - CAD drawings
- - - Git repos
- - - Simulation tools
- - AI assistant for APIs between layers in the stack
- The tool is meant for e2e open source development - includes both hardware and software stack
- - Maps out architecture
- - Solicit open source contributions
- - Output of the tool should be a recipe that someone with the needed materials and skills could follow to put together the whole project
- The way to think about it is a factory serviced by robots should be able to use the output to create the project to spec
