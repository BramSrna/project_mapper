Warning of project scope creep

Throw ideas into the project planner and it outputs a development plan. The project planner is an end-to-end tool for developing and engineering a project including:
- Planning
- Developing
- Deploying
- Maintaining
- Socializing
- Growing
The way to think about it is to provide a tool that can be used by a single person to make a simple Python package over a few days and for millions of people to build a dyson sphere over hundreds of years.
