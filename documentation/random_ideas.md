A terminal that you can use to make the project outline programatically
- ex. There would be a terminal text box that you could enter "create documentation box" into and a documentation box would be added

Warning of project scope creep

Throw ideas into the project planner and it outputs a development plan. The project planner is an end-to-end tool for developing and engineering a project including:
- Initiating: User describes their project using text, images, drawings, connections, mocks, etc. This includes requirement gathering and other preperatory work. The project description is then used to generate components.
- Planning: The components from the initiating phase are organized into a roadmap. Components are added/removed/edited as needed.
- Developing: The individual components are turned into concrete implementation details. This could be software repos, CAD drawings, etc.
- Deploying: The components from the development stage are turned into something that users can interact with. This could be hosting code on a server, a physical item, etc.
- Socializing: The final item is shown to others to get users. This could be creating a website to show of an item, bringing it to a store, etc.
- Maintaining: Repeating the planning through socializing stages as needed to fix issues or hit needed goals.
- Growing: Gathering others to work on the project
The way to think about it is to provide a tool that can be used by a single person to make a simple Python package over a few days and for millions of people to build a dyson sphere over hundreds of years.
