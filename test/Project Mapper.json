How much should the platform help with implementation?\n    - Ex. Should it have a code editor? Should it have component simulators? etc\n  - Tools for mapping out hardware and software stack\n  - Integrate tools for designing\n    - 3d printing designs\n    - CAD drawings\n    - Git repos\n    - Simulation tools\n  - AI assistant for APIs between layers in the stack\n  - The tool is meant for e2e open source development - includes both hardware and software stack\n    - Maps out architecture\n    - Solicit open source contributions\n    - Output of the tool should be a recipe that someone with the needed materials and skills could follow to put together the whole project\n      - The way to think about it is a factory serviced by robots should be able to use the output to create the project to spec"
